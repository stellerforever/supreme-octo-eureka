        <p class="pizza">The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of times the class meets in one week (2). More than 4 absences without communicating with me beforehand will result in a failing grade.
          If at any point during the semester you are unable to be present, please communicate this with me as soon as you can and we can work together to figure out how to make up the missed time. <strong>My primary concerns in this class are your wellbeing and education.</strong> <em>I try to be as accomodating as possible but need communication from you in order to do so.</em></p>
